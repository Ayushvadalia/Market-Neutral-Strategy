Overview 
Final Analysis sheet consolidates all the output data from the three reference sheets, providing a comprehensive analysis across three distinct time frames: Daily, Monthly, and 5-Years Lookback. 
It includes various tables that systematically separate in-sample and out-of-sample return calculations, ensuring clear and 
structured data representation. For example, N/BN means N long and BN short, highlighting specific 
trading positions within the strategy. 
Outputs: 
Key terms: 
In-Sample: Tested different index pairs using past data (2009–2014) and selected the 
best-performing pair for each month. 
Out-of-Sample: Applied those “best” pairs to future/unseen data (e.g., 2015–2024) to see if 
they still performed well.

Insights: 
● BN/S appears most frequently as the top performer in both in-sample and out-of-sample 
periods, suggesting strong historical performance. 
● N/BN and NF/S also perform well across different months, indicating consistency. 
● The best-performing pairs vary slightly between in-sample and out-of-sample periods, which 
suggests market dynamics shift over time, and strategies that worked well in-sample do not 
always translate perfectly to future data.
